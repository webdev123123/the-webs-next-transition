The web. What started as a document sharing platform has evolved into an
application platform. The web has been through a number of transformations over
the years. From static HTML files to dynamic server-generated HTML responses.
Then to REST or GraphQL APIs consumed by JavaScript-heavy clients with the
Jamstack. The web is entering a completely new transformation. Modern
infrastructure and techniques have changed the rules of what it means to make an
excellent user experience. In this new future, what's old is new and what's
modern is lacking.

In this keynote, Kent C. Dodds will show you how this transformation will impact
your user experience, your development productivity, and your business goals.
The future of the web is distributed. It's faster. It's cheaper. It's exciting.
Kent will show you what you can do to stay in front of it (and no, it's not
web3).

## Prerequisites

- Some
  [experience with JavaScript](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react)
- Some [experience with React](https://kcd.im/beginner-react)
- Some [experience with Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/)
- Some [experience with Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/blog)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `14 || 16 || 18`
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/the-webs-next-transformation.git
cd the-webs-next-transformation
npm run setup
```

This will take some time. This repository has many projects in it that each need
to have their own database setup. We also run type checking and the build to
make sure things are ready to rock and roll ðŸ¤˜

If you experience errors here, please open [an issue][issue] with as many
details as you can offer.

### Running each app

Each directory in the `apps` directory is a Remix app. The easiest way to run
these without having to `cd` into each directory is to use the `dev.js` script
in the root of this repository:

```sh
# to run the first app:
node dev 1
```

Each will run on a unique port so you can run multiple apps at once.

Alternatively, rather than opening this whole repo in an editor window, you open
each exercise folder in an individual editor window (this will make things like
âŒ˜+P more useful).

### Playground

The playground allows you to quickly change between the different apps via the
`advance` script:

```sh
# To set the playground to the 4th app:
node advance 4
```

Then to run the app, run:

```sh
# starts the playground in dev mode
node play
```

### Diff

You can us the `diff.js` script to be shown the differences between what's in
any of the apps. For example:

```sh
# to be shown the differences between the fifth app and the sixth:
node diff 5 6
```

This can be handy for you to run when you think you're done but things aren't
quite working as you expect.
