# In Review

- Transitions involve both Frontend and Backend
- Transitions are primarily about moving where code lives (where it's written,
  who writes it, and where it's run)
- Every transition had motivations
- Transitions can impact UX and DX in both positive and negative ways
- Every transition comes with trade-offs (including this one)
- We are often unaware of the impact of trade-offs until after the transition
- The transition to Progressively Enhanced Single Page Apps (PESPAs) improves
  both UX and DX.
